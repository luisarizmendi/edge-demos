# RHDE management with AAP Demo

## Background 

This demo is a new way of deploying the same components that you can find in [this Red Hat Device Edge GitOps demo](https://github.com/redhat-manufacturing/device-edge-workshops/blob/gitops-demo/exercises/rhde_gitops/demo/README.md) but making it easier and faster to deploy, by using the [rh_edge_mgmt Ansble collection](https://github.com/luisarizmendi/rh_edge_mgmt) that was developed for such propuse.

It does not contain all the playbooks that you might find in  [this Red Hat Device Edge GitOps demo](https://github.com/redhat-manufacturing/device-edge-workshops/blob/gitops-demo/exercises/rhde_gitops/demo/README.md) because the idea was not to recreate it completely, but giving the enough pieces to make the demo easy to extend and customize.
