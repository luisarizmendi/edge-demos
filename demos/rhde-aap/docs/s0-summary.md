    2. Open Gitea webhook settings
    3. Open "Jobs" page in AAP and keep it visible
    4. Push `rhde/prod/rhde_image/production-image-definition.yml` and `rhde/prod/rhde_image/production-kickstart.ks` files
    5. Show the "New Edge Device Image" Workflow at the AAP
    6. Open the Image Builder Cockpit Web console and check that the image is being created

    8. Go to the "New Edge Device Image" workflow in AAP and Approve the Image Publishing
    9. Open the ostree-repo contents published, including `kickstarts` and the `repos` directories in `http://192.168.122.2/<user>/prod/`.

2. Section 2 - Automated device onboarding
    1. Open the "Jobs" page in the AAP and keep it visible while performing the following steps.
    2. Boot the edge server from Network and select the right Image in the PXE menu
    3. Wait until the server bootsand review the Workflow Jobs in AAP
    4. SSH into the edge device and explain how AAP auto-registration is done

3. Section 3 - Consistent edge device configuration at scale
    - Configuration consistency across all devices
        1. Show that sudo is not asking for a password by running `sudo cat /etc/hosts` on the edge device
        2. Open "Jobs" page in AAP and keep it visible while performing the next step
        3. Change the `rhde/prod/rhde_config/os/etc/sudoers` file in Gitea to force sudo to ask for a password

        1. Open an SSH Terminal in the edge device as root user and keep the "Jobs" page in AAP visible while performing the next step
        2. Overwrite manually the `/etc/sudoers` file and remove password authentication again
        3. Show how the "Configure Edge Device" Workflow Job is being launched automatically in AAP
        4. Run `cat /etc/sudoers` in the edge device to check that you have the "right" configuration back 
        5. Show the Python script that monitors file changes in `/etc/` with `cat /usr/local/bin/watch_etc.py`

4. Section 4 - Edge computing APPs lifecycle management

    - APPs with Podman and Systemd

    - APPs with Microshift

        - Deploy an APP on Microsift from Manifest files on Gitea
            1. Show manifests located in `rhde/prod/rhde_config/apps/microshift/manifest` in Gitea.
            2. Run `watch "oc --kubeconfig /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig get pod --all-namespace"` as root
            3. Launch the  "Microshift APP Deploy - Manifest" Template in AAP

            5. Open `rhde/prod/rhde_config/apps/microshift/helm/wordpress_vars.yml` and change the `replicaCount` number
            6. Wait and see how that number of replicas is deployed on Microshift

5. Section 5 - Bulletproof system upgrades

    1. Check that there are no pending upgrades with `watch "rpm-ostree upgrade --preview"`
    2. Modify the `builder_compose_pkgs` in the image definition by removing `python-inotify` and adding `zsh`
    3. Show the Image Creation Workflow in AAP
    4. Explain Greenboot meanwhile the image is created and show the `01-check-packages.sh` script
    5. Publish the new image in AAP
    6. Check the upgrade availability with `rpm-ostree upgrade --preview` in the edge system
    7. Perform the upgrade by either running `rpm-ostree upgrade` and rebooting using the CLI or by launching the "	OSTree Upgrade" Job Template in AAP
    8. Watch the system console while the edge device tries to boot the new system image (and how to finally it fallbacks to the previous image)
    9. Show the "Upgrade Failed" message in Slack
    10. SSH to the edge device and review Greenboot and Journal messages
    11. Show with `rpm-ostree upgrade --check` that we still have pending the upgrade
    12. Create and publish the new Image by modifying the Image description in Gitea adding again the `python-inotify` package.
    13. Perform again the upgrade and check that this time the system is able to complete it.





















## DEMO deployment

## DEMO steps

### 1 - Modify the RHDE image description

* Go to Gitea in the edge management host at port `3000`
* Log in as a user (by default `user<number>`/`password<number>`)
* Modify the file in `rhde/prod/rhde_image/production-image-definition.yml`. You can include the `bind-utils` package

### 2 - Check that an Ansible Workflow automatically starts and build the new image

* Log in the AAP Controller (port `8443`) as a regular user (by default `user<number>`/`password<number>`)
* Check the "Jobs" view and see if a new Workflow has started 

### 3 - Accept the image publishing in that Workflow once the image is created

* Wait until the image is created, you can check the progress by using Cockpit (port `9090`)
* Approve the image publishing in the Workflow

### 4 - Create an ISO to deploy the image

* Launch the `Create ISO Kickstart` task under "Templates" view in AAP Controller. Default variables should be ok unless you are not using default values for this demo
* Download the ISO from the URL shown in the last `debug` message that you will find in the `Create ISO Kickstart` task output (maybe you need to "Reload output" when the task is done to see the debug message at the end)

  >**Note**
  >
  > If you create/publish new versions of your image for your demo, you don't need to create additional ISO images, you will be able to re-use the same ISO while the environment (`prod`) or the image name changes.


### 5 - Deploy the image in the edge device

* Start the edge device from the ISO that you downloaded (using an USB if it's a physical device).
* Wait until the deployment finishes. Then the device will reboot and use the local drive as first boot option
* Wait a little bit until you see in AAP Controller a new Workflow execution (`Provision Edge Device` Workflow)


### 6 - Check that the device is auto-registered in AAP and correctly onboarded (in this base demo it is just a change in the hostname)

* Log into the edge deivice (you can check the IP in the AAP inventory)
* Check that the hostname was changed and a new entry configured in `/etc/hosts`
* You can also take a look at the Event Driven Automation Controller (port `8445`, credentials `admin`/`R3dh4t1!` if not customized during the deployment) to check out how the request were processed.
