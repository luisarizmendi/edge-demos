# Secure Edge device onboarding with RHEL and FDO

  >**Note**
  >
  > This demo was prepared to be run with RHEL 9.1. In RHEL 9.2 Ignition support was added and this dependancy makes the workshop fail if you are using 9.2 or newer releases. If you want to have FDO running for your demo in 9.3 you might [take a look at the `rhde-aap` demo in Section 6](../rhde-aap/README.md).

The content was generated in fact as a self-paced workshop, but it can be adapted to be used as a demo.

The workshop was created using the [Red Hat Scholars courseware-template](https://github.com/redhat-scholars/courseware-template). If you want to take a look at the code you will find it in [this repository](https://github.com/luisarizmendi/tutorial-secure-onboarding).

The workshop is published automatically in Github.io:
